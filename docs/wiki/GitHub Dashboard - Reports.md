# Dashboard

With the previous backend deployed, you can now download the [GitHubContributions.pbit][GitHubContributionsDashboard] file and open it locally. You will be asked to enter:
- The name of the storage account you deployed.
![Storage Account Name][StorageAccountName]

- The Storage account [access key][StorageAccountAccessKey].

After that you will be able to monitor your contributions!

![GitHub Contributions][GitHubContributions]
