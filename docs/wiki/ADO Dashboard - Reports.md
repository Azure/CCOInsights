# Dashboard

With the previous back-end deployed, you can now download the [ADOContributions.pbit][AdoContributionsDashboard] and run it locally. You will be asked to enter:
- The name of the Storage account you deployed.

![Storage Account Name][StorageAccountName]

- The Storage account [access key][StorageAccountAccessKey].

After that you will be able to monitor your contributions!

![Ado Contributions][AdoContributions]
