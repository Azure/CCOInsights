## Resource Providers requirements

Although some of the Resource Providers might be enabled by default, you need to make sure that at least the **Microsoft.Security** resource provider is registered across all the  subscriptions that you plan analyze using the Dashboard. 

Registering this Resource Provider has no cost or performance penalty on the subscription:

1. Click on **Subscriptions**.
2. Click on the Subscription name you want to configure.
3. Click on **Resource Providers**.
4. Click on **Microsoft.Security** and **Register**.

# Installing the custom connector

We need to install a custom connector because we're using some queries with POST method. Also If we don't have the correct access a forbidden error message is thrown and the error handling from the product don't know how to process that type of message. To avoid these conflicts, we're managing the error handling and the POST method queries using the custom connector.  

To install the custom connector you must copy the file [CCoDashboardAzureConnector.mez](https://github.com/josunefon/ccodashboard/blob/master/dashboards/CCODashboard-Governance/CcoDashboardAzureConnector.mez) from the **ccodashboard/dashboards/CCODashboard-Governance/** folder to the folder that Power BI creates by default in the Documents folder in your PC. If this folder doesn't exist, you can create a new one with this name. 

The path should be **C:\Users\%YOUR_USER%\Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors**

Then go to Power BI Options and under Global category in the Security section, select **(Not Recommended) Allow any extension to load without validation or warning** and click **OK**.

# Setting up the CCO Azure Governance Dashboard Governance
## Credentials
By default, the template doesn't have any Azure Account credentials preloaded. Hence, the first step to start showing subscriptions data is to sign-in with the right user credentials.

### Clean Credentials on the Data Source
In some cases, old credentials are cached by previous logins using Power BI Desktop and the dashboard might show errors or blank fields.

- Click on Data sources in **Current file/Global permissions**.
- Click on **Clear Permissions**.
- Click on **Clear All Permissions**.

### Refresh the dashboard
If the permissions and credentials are properly flushed it should ask you for credentials for each REST API and you will have to set the Privacy Levels for each of them.

- Click on **Refresh**.
