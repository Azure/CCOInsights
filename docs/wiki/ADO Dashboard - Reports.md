# Dashboard

With the previous back-end deployed, you can now download the [ADOContributions.pbit][AdoContributionsDashboard] and run it locally. You will be asked to enter:
- The Storage Account name of the Storage Account you deployed.
![Storage Account Name][StorageAccountName]
- The Storage account access key.

After that you will be able to monitor your contributions!

![Ado Contributions][AdoContributions]
